__I don't know if we want to do our active development in an interactive python file or a Jupyter notebook because during Bitcamp git played much nicer with the `.py` files than `.ipynb`. VSCode allows you to easily export between the two formats but I suspect replacing the `.ipynb` each time may also cause problems. At the time of this commit `main.py` and `main.ipynb` are equivalent, so you can see what the respective formats look like when you run markdown cells.__
